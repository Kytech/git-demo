Here's the general overview of how we'll go through this:

1. Start with the basic commands, just enough for you to save, push, and pull stuff.
2. Next, we'll talk about how to take advantage of this history you're making.
3. I'll show you some things about branching, stashing, and a few other items that will make your life easier.
4. We'll take a minute to talk about merging
5. I'll touch just a bit on a few more techniques that are nice to know, but are a bit of a next step up.
6. We'll talk about that second link on the top of the page that you're probably wondering about.
