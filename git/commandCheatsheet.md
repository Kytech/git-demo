# Summary of Commands

- `git init` - This is where the magic starts. Creates a new, empty repository on your computer.
- `git add` - Adds a file's changes to the staging area. Lets you pick and choose what changes you want to record.
- `git restore` - When you've been editing a file, but want to roll back before committing
- `git commit` - Records your edits for the record books in a commit. Works a lot like a checkpoint as you're working through a tough level.
- `git log` - Take a trip down memory lane, see the commit history
- `git remote` - Ready to start pushing code around, so you can "git" it from somewhere else later? This will link things up.
- `git push` - Beam me up scotty! Sends all your committed changes to the remote repository you setup with git remote. Sends things from your computer to the interet. This command is what we use to push to a remote repository in git speak.
- `git fetch` - Make the minion check the mail for you. See if there's been anything new up on the remote.

## All this git speak... How do I keep track of it?

- `git help <command>` will help you keep track of the specifics involved in each command.
